This is Holo Companion. An experimental companion program for use with writeholo.com. The goal of the project is to bridge the gap between ai generated stories like HoloAi and traditional text adventures. So far this program includes a dice rolling mechanic, which allows you to attempt actions with a chance of failure, and a map, which helps keep track of your movements in a story.


GETTING STARTED

Run the program.

Once open it will ask you for the name of your map file. Input the name and file extension of the map file and select your preferred web browser from the dropdrown menu. Make sure the map file is in the folder with the Holo Companion executable. Browsers with an asterisk* next to their name have not been tested and may not work.

A webpage should open on the writeholo homepage. Create or navigate to a your story. *Warning: Once you open a story don't leave that story without closing the program or you may get errors.

After opening a story the companion program should load and you may begin.


USING THE DICE ROLL 
*only works in second person

Plug in an action like "kill the goblin" or "jump the gap" as well as a success percentage and the program will calculate a success or failure and automatically write it in the story document.

USING THE MAP

Your current location is represented by a golden ring on the map.

Travel along the map grid using the arrow buttons at the bottom of the program.

Red arrows on each square represent each direction you can travel on that square.

As you travel the program will generate descriptions of the places you go as well as random events tied to the tiles you enter.

The two buttons in the bottom right corner disable random events and tile descriptions should you find need to use them.
